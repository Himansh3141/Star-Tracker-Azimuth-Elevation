# Star-Tracker-Azimuth-Elevation
The functionality of my star tracker project. The process begins with selecting a planet name on the GUI, followed by pressing the "Load" button to initiate the process. Next the MATLAB Mobile app is used to transfer real-time coordinates, including latitude, longitude, and altitude, to the MATLAB code.
The MATLAB code then processes this data to calculate the real-time position of the selected planet relative to my location. Subsequently, the GUI displays the calculated azimuthal and elevation angles. Once the data is shown, The "Run" button is pressed to execute the model on Simulink, demonstrating the star tracker's ability to simulate and visualize the planet's position in real-time.
